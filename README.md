rest-client.js README
=======================

This client is still a rough draft of how one could make this client happen.
The api is subject to change and comments and help is appriciated!

* Version: 1.0-dev
* Date: not-yet-released

What is rest-client.js?
-----------------------

rest-client.js is a library to communicate with RESTful services. It uses
jQuery as ajax library. It's aim is to provide a very simple API to follow
the `links` defined in a request response, thus achieving
level 3 in `Richardson Maturity Model`.

Requirements:

* jQuery 1.5+

How does it work?
-----------------

If you include `rest-client.js` after your `jQuery.js`, you'll have the ability
to make such requests:

    var a = new HttpAgent('/api');
    a.navigate(['coffee', {'name': 'Small'}, "buy"]);
    a.post(function(response) {
        // response.getValue() contains what the POST /api/orders?product_id=5 returned
    });

This example assumes that the responses contain

    GET /api
        {
            "links": [ { "rel": "coffee", "href": "/api/coffee" } ]
        }
    GET /api/coffee
        [
            {
                "id": 5,
                "name": "Small",
                "links": [ { "rel": "buy", "href": "/api/orders?product_id=5" } ]
            }
        ]

Todos
-----

* add support for other responses (xml, maybe a generic converter system or usage of the one from jQuery)
* handle status codes other then 200 (currently only 200 is JsonHttpResponse#isOk() == true and 201 is interpreted)
* add documentation for `HttpAgent`, `JsonHttpResponse`, `AtomXmlHttpResponse` and `XmlHttpResponse`
* support mimetypes
* ... more as soon as I get to that!
